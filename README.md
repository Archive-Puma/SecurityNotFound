## üìº Clone me!

Clone or download the project:

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/CosasDePuma/SecurityNotFound.git
```

## üì¶ "Installation"

The `src/404.php` file should be located on the target server.

That server must have the ability to execute `.php` files.

Here is an example of some of the most common routes on which servers are located:

```sh
# üèÅ Windows (Xampp)
C:\Xampp\htdocs\

# üêß Linux
/var/www/html/
```

> :warning:  Obviously, you and I know that you have **legitimate** access to that server.


## üö™ Access Granted!

Now, you can access it through the browser:

```sh
https://www.example.com/404.php
```

<br>
<p align="center"><img src=".github/readme/404.png"/></p>
<br>

> üí° You can replace the server 404 error template to access from any invalid URL.

To access the control panel, press `TAB` key or search the password field using your browser's tools:

<br>
<p align="center"><img src=".github/readme/secret.png"/></p>
<br>

The default password is: `cosasdepuma`.

> ü•ö You can leave the `$passphrase` variable in the script as an empty string to directly access the control panel.

> üîí To set a custom value, insert your password into the `$passphrase` variable after applying the ``MD5`` algorithm three consecutive times.

## üéÆ Control Panel

Once logged in, the webshell will show its real appearance:

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/readme/webshell.png"/>
</p>

The panel features an AJAX console and a number of preconfigured actions:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PHP Info | Shows `phpinfo();` page. |
| Geolocate | Shows in `Google Maps` the place where the server is physically located. |
| Exploit-DB (...) | Searches for compatible exploits in `exploit-db.com`. |
| Log out | Exits the dashboard. |

It should be noted that the execution of commands is performed using the **"Referrer"** header, its content being the executed payload.

This has two advantages: greater stealth within the log file and the ability to execute commands without the need to access the web interface.
